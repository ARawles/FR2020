--

- Q & A

---

# A brief history

- Fortran

--

   - Developed by IBM in the 1950s
   
--

   - Suited to numeric computation and scientific computing
   - Became the basis for many other programming languages like BASIC
   
--

- S (1976)

--

   - John Chambers
   
--

   - "...designed to offer an alternative and more interactive approach [to Fortran]"
   
--

   - Originally called Fortran to do most of the computing, but many of the internal functions were rewritten using C in 1988
   
--

- R (1995)

--

   - Ross Ihaka & Robert Gentleman
   
--

   - "R can be considered as a different implementation of S"

---

# What is R?


--

- Statistical programming language

--

- Open-source

--

- 9th most popular programming language ([TIOBE index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index]))

--

- Functional programming language

--

   - Object-oriented systems
   
--

- Interpreted language

--

  - R needs to be installed to R code
  - But there's growing support for web apps...
  
--

- Supported with over 15,000 open-source packages (written primarily in R, but also Java, C, C++, and Fortran)

--

   - Provided through the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/))


---

# R vs. other languages

- Functional vs. Object-oriented

--

- Designed for data analysis, not really software development

--

- Human-readable syntax

---


# Using R

--

- What can you use R for?

--

   - Reporting
   - Data analysis
   - Statistics and machine learning
   - Data driven web apps
   - Presentations

- How do you code in R?

--

   - RStudio
   - Visual Studio Code
   
- What does R code look like?

--

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}

v1 <- "hello"
v2 <- "world"
cat(v1, v2)

```
