# Summary

--

- A brief history

--

- What is R?

--

- R vs. other languages

--

- Using R (including an example)

--

- Q & A

---

# A brief history

- Fortran

--

   - Developed by IBM in the 1950s
   
--

   - Suited to numeric computation and scientific computing
   - Became the basis for many other programming languages like BASIC
   
--

- S (1976)

--

   - John Chambers
   
--

   - "...designed to offer an alternative and more interactive approach [to Fortran]"
   
--

   - Originally called Fortran to do most of the computing, but many of the internal functions were rewritten using C in 1988
   
--

- R (1995)

--

   - Ross Ihaka & Robert Gentleman
   
--

   - "R can be considered as a different implementation of S"

---

# What is R?


--

- Statistical programming language

--

- Open-source

--

- 9th most popular programming language ([TIOBE index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index]))

--

- Functional programming language

--

   - Object-oriented systems
   
--

- Interpreted language

--

  - R needs to be installed to R code
  - But there's growing support for web apps...
  
--

- Supported with over 15,000 open-source packages (written primarily in R, but also Java, C, C++, and Fortran)

--

   - Provided through the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/))


---

# R vs. other languages

- Functional vs. Object-oriented

--

- Designed for data analysis, not really software development

--

- Human-readable syntax

---


# Using R

--

- What can you use R for?

--

   - Reporting
   - Data analysis
   - Statistics and machine learning
   - Data driven web apps
   - Presentations

- How do you code in R?

--

   - RStudio
   - Visual Studio Code
   
- What does R code look like?

--

```{r}
1 + 1
```

```{r}

v1 <- "hello"
v2 <- "world"
cat(v1, v2)

```
---

# Example

- [CodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

- Dataset containing tutorials and some stats

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/data_preview.png")
```
]

- We're going to use the Tidyverse packages to load and analyse the data


---

# Loading the data


--

```{r}
cc_data <- readr::read_csv("code_camp_data.csv")
head(cc_data, 10)
```

---

# Cleaning the data

--

```{r}
cc_data$Date <- as.Date(cc_data$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
```


---

# Summarising the data 

--

```{r}
library(dplyr)

summarised_cc_data <- cc_data %>%
   dplyr::group_by(Date) %>%
   dplyr::summarise(average_read_ratio = mean(`Read ratio`)) %>%
   dplyr::ungroup()

head(summarised_cc_data, 10)
```

---

# Plotting the data

--

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(summarised_cc_data, aes(x = Date, y = average_read_ratio)) +
   geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x) +
   scale_x_date(name = "Date", date_labels = "%b %y") +
   scale_y_continuous(name = "Average Read Ratio") +
   theme_classic()
```
---
.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/plug.svg")
```
